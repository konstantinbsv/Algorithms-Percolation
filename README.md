# Algorithms-Percolation

Estimate the percolation threshold of by Monte Carlo simulation.

## Precolation.java
Creates n-by-n grid and uses weighted quiz union-find in keeping track of open and full sites and for detextinf percolation

## PercolationStats.java
Given grid size and number of trials, runs Monte Carlo simulation on Percolation. Prints mean threshold, standard deviation,
and 95% confidence interval.
