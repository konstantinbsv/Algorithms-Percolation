# Algorithms-Percolation

Estimate the percolation threshold by Monte Carlo simulation.

## Precolation.java
Creates n-by-n grid and uses weighted quick union-find in keeping track of open and full sites and for detecting percolation.

## PercolationStats.java
Given grid size and number of trials, runs Monte Carlo simulation. Prints mean threshold, standard deviation,
and 95% confidence interval.
